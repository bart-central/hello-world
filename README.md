# hello-world

Hello all,

I'm currently trying to learn PYTHON (and GitHub!) in order to update my skillset.  Currently, I plan to try and get a solid understanding of PTYHON basics - including how to write test scripts in PYTHON for both UI and API testing.  I will then follow this with learning the basics of selenium and how it can be used with PYTHON test scripts.  Somewhere between now and then, I will work out what the next steps will be after achieving the above-mentioned goals.
